                        <p>My name is Marcos Macho and I am from Puerto Cumarebo, Venezuela. I live with my parents and
                            I have two younger brothers. I have lived in Venezuela all my life, so my native language is
                            Spanish, but I also like English. As for my interests, I enjoy music, I like movies and
                            series, I love reading books, and I am passionate about graphic design.</p>

                        <p>Venezuela is a country on the northern coast of South America. It is known for its diverse
                            landscapes, including the Andes, the Amazon rainforest, vast plains (the Llanos) and the
                            Caribbean coast. The capital is Caracas.
                            Venezuela is rich in natural resources, particularly oil, and has one of the largest oil
                            reserves in the world. This has played a major role in its economy and development. The
                            country's culture is a vibrant mix of indigenous, African and Spanish influences, reflected
                            in its music, dance and culinary traditions.</p>
